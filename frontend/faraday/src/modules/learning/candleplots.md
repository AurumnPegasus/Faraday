The demand and supply of a particular stock rely heavily on the perception of a majority of investors. Further, this perception is influenced by various factors like economic conditions, political stability, social events, the performance of the company, etc. While it is impossible for traders to stay at the top of all factors that influence the share price, by carefully analyzing the market/stock’s performance, they can make efficient trading decisions. One such tool available to day traders is a Candlestick Chart. we will talk about these Candlestick Charts and offer steps to help you read them

## Composition of a Candlestick Chart

As can be seen above, each candle stick is composed of 3 main parts:
1. Body
2. Upper Wick
3. Lower Wick

The body maybe red or green, depending on parameters. Each candle is a representation of a time stamp, and the data corresponds to the trades executed during that period.

- Open – the first trade during the period specified by the candle
- High – the highest traded price
- Low – the lowest traded price
- Close – the last trade during the period specified by the candle

Colour of body is determined by whether Open > Close (or not). If it is, then colour of candle is green, if it is not, then colour of candle is red. Try confirming this in the  interactive chart above!
